1. Never push surprise broken stuff. Everything in the commit must work or all known bugs must be listed.
2. Be descriptive. The All commits must at least have a name or title describing what they are/do.
3. NEVER push to main or BUILD. These brnahces serve as rollback in case something horrible happens and must never be scuffed. 
4. Pull before pushing. To prevent loss of progress; if you are pushing directly to a source branch (Dev/Art) 
then please pull first, this will minimize the chance of someones changes being overwritten.
5. If you wish to create your own branch, please manage it well; don't change the gitignore, or add weird files that will blot the repo
6. Lastly, be sensible; these rules are here to preserve the working state of the Git, trying to find workarounds or loopholes will only detriment everyone.
